## Description

This project is a React application that utilizes Node.js for backend functionality and makes API calls to fetch data. It also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and includes functionality to navigate to the next page when clicking on an eye icon.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the command line interface (CLI).
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary Node modules for your project.

## Usage

### API Call Using useEffect

1. Implement the useEffect hook in your React component to make API calls.
2. Inside the useEffect hook, use fetch or a library like Axios to fetch data from your API endpoint.
3. Make sure to handle any errors and update the component state accordingly.

### Design Using Tailwind CSS

1. Utilize Tailwind CSS classes in your React components to style your application.
2. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for the list of available utility classes and how to use them.
3. Apply Tailwind classes directly in your JSX or use them within CSS files if you're using a build process like PostCSS.

### Eye Icon Click Navigate to Next Page

1. Implement a click event handler for the eye icon in your React component.
2. Inside the event handler, use React Router (if you're using it for navigation) or any other navigation method to navigate to the next page.
3. Ensure proper routing configuration to map the URL path to the corresponding component.
